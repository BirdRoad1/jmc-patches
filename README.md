# JClient

A modified Minecraft client for games such as Hypixel Bedwars.

## Where is the code?
Minecraft code is copyrighted, so I cannot publicly release the entire repo. Rather, this project is released as a set of patches that contain any modifications made to the game's codebase. To use this, you must use [Mod Coder Pack 918](http://www.modcoderpack.com/), decompile the game, and paste [Optifine SRC code](https://github.com/Hexeption/Optifine-SRC) into the code. Then, you can use git-apply to apply patches to the game's code.

I plan to make a bytecode diffing and patching tool at a later date to simplify this process.

Note that these patches contain every commit, if you're interested at looking at the commit history for the project.
